An exercise in calling information from an internet server


Ok so it's been a while since I've done some programming, guess summer laziness hit me hard. Nevertheless, I'm getting back on track with this small project. Should be pretty easy, just have to figure out which API to use for Java, since I'm guessing most are built for HTML webpages.

Also, I'm going to be posting some old projects from school once I get my laptop to connect to the internet again. They're nothing special, just old assignments that might be useful for my portfolio.
